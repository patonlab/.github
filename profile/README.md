### our philosophy

Solving problems in chemistry and engineering with computers

### who we are

*The Gomes group is broadly interested in the development of novel
reactions, catalysis and materials. We seek to solve these problems by combining
state-of-the-art machine learning with computational chemistry methods. We are also early adopters
of experimental automation. Our hope is a revolution in how chemistry is asked, explored and answered.*
